# Recipe Page

This is a project for the [Techtonica Apprenticeship](https://techtonica.org/), following Techtonica's open source [curriculum](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum).

The project is a simple page with a recipe for an easy, yet delicious, Fettuccine Alfredo Ã  la my mom (she's a GREAT cook and baker). I have enjoyed many a nights with wine and good company, making what tastes like a 5 star meal with these simple steps and ingredients. Pair with a butter Chardonnay or some Pinot Noir to take this meal to the next level. Enjoy!

## Getting Started

If, for some reason, you'd like to run this project locally, you can simply

```
git clone https://github.com/zhagm/Recipe-Page.git
cd Recipe-Page
```

and open up index.html in your browser, perhaps using the following command:

```
open ./index.html -a Google\ Chrome
```

Voila! The recipe page should be open in your browser now.
If you don't want a local copy of this project but you'd still love to make yourself some Alfredo, you can find the link [here]().
